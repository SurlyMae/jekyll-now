    - May be perceived as a one-sided networker, using networks solely for own advantage

**Leading discussions:**  

- Don't let the discussion wander. Bringing in specific quotes, problems, or other samples of the material can ensure that even underprepared participants will have something to talk about.
- Use open-ended questions and ask participants for clarification, examples, definitions.
- Summarize responses without taking a stand one way or another.
- Toward the end of the discussion, review the main ideas, the thread of the discussion, and conclusions.

**General Notes from Readings:**  

- Your employees understand their jobs. They know their tasks, roles, and functions within the org, and it's time for you to let them do what they need to do to get the job done. Your role is to encourage and support the decision-making environment, and give employees the tools and knowledge they need to make and act upon their own decisions. If a company has a history of shutting down or letting go of initiators, the leader can't tell employees, "You are empowered."  
    - What can a leader do when they are driving engagement, but their leader is not?
- Energy, not time, is the currency of engagement. Engagement is the combination of the perception of changes and events happening around you, and the level of energy experienced. So, highly engaged people have positive perceptions of changes going on around them and they put a high level of energy into their work and everything else they do.
    - What creates this positive perception? Being engaged, but WHY/HOW?
    - Engaged employees take ownership of what they do and how they do it; how do leaders encourage this state? Create conditions in which they choose to be engaged.

**Employee Development:**  
Ask for development until it stings!
- What would you like to do?
- Where do you see yourself?
- What are your aspirations?
- Use the resources, tools, people around you
- Where you are:
    - job title
    - job description
    - behavior
    - performance
        - requires self-reflection
        - leader and peer feedback
- Where you want to go:
    - growth conversations
    - where do I want to grow my skillset?
    - what follows my interests?
    - what supports the business?
    - what do you like to do?
    - what are you good at?
    - what do you want to accomplish in the role you're taking on?


Leadership webinar notes: (spring into leadership 3/10)

67% of women rate having a mentor as very important to career, but only 37% don't have a workplace mentor
women ask for mentorships less often than men
companies with formalized mentorship programs are more profitable, while the people being mentored are more successful
 "I can just do it myself" - how this relates to the CHG culture and how this is not what we need to grow and improve
 Utah Business article about women execs not able to get hired in Utah
 Fear of asking people in superior roles to mentor
biz idea: consultancy that sets up these formal mentorship programs in companies?
establish rapport and relationship and build on that
know where you do well, know where you need help, find people to fill those skills gaps. don't try to 'network' your way through the org
have a very clear ask



Servant leadership:
True leadership emerges from those whose primary motivation is a deep desire to help others.

The best test is: Do those served grow as persons; do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?

The servant leader seeks to identify the will of a group and helps clarify that will. She strives to understand and empathize with others. She assumes the good intentions of coworkers and does not reject them as people, even if she finds it necessary to refuse to accept their behavior or performance. She relies on persuasion over coercion. She is effective at building consensus within groups. She believes that people have an intrinsic value beyond their tangible contributions as coworkers. She is deeply committed to the growth of each and every individual within the institution. She seeks to identify some means for building community among the org's people.


Great leaders exercise power by virtue of their passion and who they are. They possess the ability to make things happen by encouraging and inspiring others and acting as a catalyst for change. They are teachable. They show genuine concern for their team - the whole person, including life outside of work. They provide positive feedback, ask for team input and involve them in pivotal decisions. They model the way they want their team to act. They are authentic and honest. They work hard at being themselves, telling the truth, and investing in others.
