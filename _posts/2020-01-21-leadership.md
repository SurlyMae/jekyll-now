_I'm participating in my employer's leadership training program. Notes and whatnot!_

**My focuses:**
<ins>Driving Engagement:<ins>
    - Less skilled:
        - Has little insight into what motivates others
        - Doesn't give people enough flexibility and autonomy to do their work
        - Does little to create enthusiasm
        - Is unwilling to share ownership and give up control of assignments
    - Skilled:
        - Structures the work so it aligns with people's goals and motivators
        - Empowers others
        - Makes each person feel their contributions are important
        - Invites input and shares ownership and visibility
        - Shows a clear connection between people's motivators and the organizational goals
    - Talented:
        - Creates a positive and motivating work environment
        - Knows what motivates different people and aligns work accordingly
        - Gives others appropriate latitude to get work done
        - Invites input from others
        - Makes people feel that their contributions are visible and valued
    - Overused:
        - May accommodate others' motivators at the expense of getting needed work done
        - May empower beyond people's capacity
        - May avoid giving constructive feedback if it could negatively impact engagement
