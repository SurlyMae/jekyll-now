_What's functional programming?_

- Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state, avoids mutable data
- Declarative paradigm 
    - programming done with expressions or declarations instead of statements
- Declarative programming 
    - expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow
    - like asking someone to draw a landscape, you don't care how, it's up to them
- Imperative programming 
    - uses statements to change a program's state
    - like your friend listening to Bob Ross tell them how to paint a landscape, step-by-step instructions
- Pure functions 
    - return a value solely based on what was passed into it
    - doesn't modify values outside of its scope 
    - never mutates data, produces no side effects, can be easily reused
