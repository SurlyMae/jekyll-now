Public:
- Indicates there are no special restrictions on the use of the method.

Methods:
- Every method belongs to some class & is available to objects created from that class. The definition of a method is given in the definition of the class to which it belongs.

Instance variables:
- Data fields belonging to each instance of the class (each object). Instance variables are written differently depending on whether they are within the class (`this.instanceVariable` or `instanceVariable`) or outside of the class (as inside a program that uses the class, i.e. `receivingObject.instanceVariable`).
