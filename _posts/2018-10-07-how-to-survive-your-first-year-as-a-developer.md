# So you're a developer now! Here's how to survive.

- Lean on your community.
- Network! (but maybe networking isn't what you think)
- Don't compare yourself to others.
- People often bluff. (especially developers?)
- Hormones can affect your confidence.
- Your self is important. Care for it.
- Give your brain playtime.
- Pick a thing - then RUN WITH IT!
- Do what works for YOU.
