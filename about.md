I'm hoping you won't judge my site too much. For the past couple of years I've had my stuff up via WordPress, but I've finally decided to do this myself, and it's definitely a work-in-progress as of September 2018. Lots of blog posts to transfer over - it's such a hassle though, maybe I'll just start fresh! Not to mention, I have a lot of other stuff in my life that comes first - working full-time, going to school for a CS degree, and hanging out with my family. So just know that I know this isn't yet a good representative of who I am as a developer, and that I'm working on it!

### Now that we have that out of the way...

Hi, I'm Ashly!
I work as a developer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah, and volunteer in the tech community whenever I can. I was in accounting for a decade - most recently as a Financial Controller - before I became a developer. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me enjoying the culinary delights of downtown SLC, lounging poolside in Vegas, or hibernating in my house with a good historical book.
