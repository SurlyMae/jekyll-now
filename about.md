I'm hoping you won't judge my site too much. For the past couple of years I've had my stuff up via WordPress, but I've finally decided to do this myself, and it's definitely a work-in-progress as of September 2018. Not to mention, I have a lot of other stuff in my life that comes first - working full-time, going to school for a CS degree, and hanging out with my family.
