Hi, I'm Ashly!
I work as a software engineer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah. Before this,Â I was in accounting for a decade - most recently as a Financial Controller. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me enjoying the culinary delights of downtown SLC, lounging poolside in Vegas, or hibernating in my house with a good historical book. 
*(Update spring 2020: Of course, now that the 'rona is here, you can only find me at home.)

What will you find here? This is pretty much a site for personal use - mostly a collection of my tech notes that I can access from anywhere, with a few scattered blog posts. Welcome and thanks for reading!
