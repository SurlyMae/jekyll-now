I'm hoping you won't judge my site too much. For the past couple of years I've had my stuff up via WordPress, but I've finally decided to do this myself, and it's definitely a work-in-progress as of September 2018. Turns out, I was writing about a lot of stuff I thought I 'should' be writing about, instead of writing about what actually excites me - things like design patterns and architecture, how the Google crawler and indexer works, and what it's like to move an entire codebase from .NET to .NET core. I'm on a mission to fix that, but I have a lot of other stuff in my life that comes first - working full-time, getting my CS degree, and hanging out with my family. So just know this isn't yet a good representative of who I am as a developer, and that I'm working on it!

### Now that we have that out of the way...

Hi, I'm Ashly!
I work as a developer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah, and volunteer in the tech community whenever I can. I was in accounting for a decade - most recently as a Financial Controller handling \$25 million a year - before I became a developer. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me enjoying the culinary delights of downtown SLC, lounging poolside in Vegas, or hibernating in my house with a good historical book.
I try to write about things that I'm learning, and I try to write them in a way that will help you learn, too. I'm not interested in appearing more knowledgeable than I am, or referencing things I don't fully understand. There is a lot of that BS in the tech scene and you won't find it here. Welcome and thanks for reading!
