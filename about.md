Hi, I'm Ashly!
I work as a developer in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah, and volunteer in our _amazing_ tech community whenever I can. Before this, I was in accounting for a decade - most recently as a Financial Controller. I'm working in C#/.NET right now but have yet to find a language I don't enjoy. When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me enjoying the culinary delights of downtown SLC, lounging poolside in Vegas, or hibernating in my house with a good historical book.

I mostly write about things that I'm learning, and I try to write in a way that will help you learn, too. I'm not interested in appearing more knowledgeable than I am, or referencing things I don't fully understand. There is a lot of that BS in the tech scene and you won't find it here. Welcome and thanks for reading!
